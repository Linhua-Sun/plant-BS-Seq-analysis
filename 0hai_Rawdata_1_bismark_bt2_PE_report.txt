Bismark report for: 0hai_Rawdata_1.fq.gz and 0hai_Rawdata_2.fq.gz (version: v0.17.0)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /data1/linhua/QIANLAB/PROJECT/DNA_methylation_data_process/First_test/WGBS_INDEX/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	113253297
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	76198596
Mapping efficiency:	67.3% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	14962543
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	22092158
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	255

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	37896160	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	38302181	((converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
